# Official task — Sprint 3 Final Project: "Ship an AI App of Your Own"

Verbatim brief as provided by the user on 2026-07-25, kept for reference so a
fresh session can verify scope decisions against the original wording without
relying on `README.md`'s summary.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this part, you should be able to:

- Choose an AI-powered product idea and articulate clearly why the AI feature is core, not decorative
- Direct Claude Code to wire an OpenRouter LLM call server-side, with the key never reaching the browser
- Build at least one form of memory or persistence appropriate to the app — conversation history, saved outputs, or RAG-indexed data — using Supabase
- Build and run an authenticated, AI-powered app and confirm that signed-out visitors are locked out, checked in an incognito window

## Overview

This is the Sprint 3 sprint project. Every skill from the sprint comes together here: the security and deployment workflow from the security and deployment lessons, and the AI features from the AI apps lesson and the RAG lesson. You choose the app. You design the AI feature. You ship it.

The only non-negotiable is that AI is the core of the app, not a bolt-on. An AI feature that a user would never miss is not enough.

Security is a baseline expectation this time, not the centrepiece. Do it — it is required — but do not let it crowd out the AI work. The AI feature is what your reviewer will spend the most time on, and what you will spend the most time explaining.

### Topics

- Designing and scoping an AI-powered product idea
- OpenRouter LLM calls and key safety
- Persistent memory: conversation history and/or RAG over user data with pgvector
- Supabase auth and Row Level Security as baseline expectations

## Task description

You are designing and shipping an AI-powered web app of your own invention. The domain, the name, and the user experience are yours to choose. The only hard requirement is that an AI feature — powered by an LLM via OpenRouter — is the thing the app is built around.

A plain general-purpose chatbot (the kind you built in the AI apps lab) is not enough on its own. That was the foundation; this project requires a specific job, persona, or data grounding on top. Your AI feature should have a clear purpose: it helps a specific kind of user do a specific thing. The more concrete the job, the better the app.

To spark your thinking, here are five ideas. These are starting points, not the full list — your own idea is welcome and encouraged.

1. "Chat with your own notes" knowledge assistant. A user pastes or types their notes and documents into the app, and can then ask questions about them. The AI answers from the user's actual content using RAG over their Supabase-stored notes, not from its general training.
2. Study buddy and flashcard generator. The user pastes study material — a textbook chapter, lecture notes, a revision guide — and the AI generates flashcard questions and answers, quizzes the user, and tracks which topics they find hardest.
3. Journaling app with AI reflection. The user writes a journal entry and the AI offers a short, empathetic reflection or asks a follow-up question to prompt deeper thinking. Entries and reflections are saved per user.
4. Recipe assistant from ingredients. The user lists what is in their fridge and the AI suggests meals they could make, with full recipes. Preferences and dietary rules are saved and applied in every session.
5. Writing coach with a persona. The user pastes a draft and the AI plays the role of a specific persona (a direct editor, a gentle encourager, a technical reviewer) and gives targeted feedback. The persona and feedback history are saved per user.

Each of these is buildable with the tools from this sprint: OpenRouter for the LLM call, Supabase for per-user persistence, and (for the notes assistant and any memory-heavy variant) pgvector and `openai/text-embedding-3-small` for RAG.

How the three building blocks connect: the LLM call happens on the server, the key never leaves it — a signed-in user sends a request to the server, the server calls OpenRouter with the API key, and both a result to the user and data saved to Supabase come back out.

## Task requirements

The exact task requirements are as follows:

1. **A self-chosen app with AI at its core.** Pick an idea where the AI feature is the main reason to use the app. Describe your idea clearly in `CLAUDE.md` — including why the app would be pointless without it.
2. **Supabase authentication in place.** Sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out all work. A signed-out visitor cannot view, create, edit, or delete any data — not even through a direct URL.
3. **The AI feature works, with the OpenRouter call server-side only.** The app makes a real LLM call via OpenRouter and the result is visible to the user. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` lives in `.env.local`, is read server-side only, and is never prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. If the agent's diff shows it anywhere browser-accessible, stop and ask for a fix before merging.
4. **Some form of memory or persistence appropriate to the app, stored in Supabase with RLS on every table.** This could be conversation history saved per user, AI-generated outputs stored for later review, or RAG-indexed content embedded with `openai/text-embedding-3-small` and stored in a `documents` table with `vector(1536)` columns. Every table that stores user data must have Row Level Security enabled with at least one owner-scoped policy.
5. **Secrets handled safely.** All secrets — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and your Supabase keys — live in `.env.local`, which is git-ignored and never committed. No secret is ever exposed through a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable. Only the Supabase anon key may appear in environment variables; the service-role key must never appear in any client-accessible variable.
6. **`ai-code-reviewer` run on at least one pull request before merging.** Record the report.
7. **`CLAUDE.md` includes the AI rules.** At minimum:

   ```markdown
   AI model calls:
   - All LLM and embedding calls must happen server-side only. Never call OpenRouter
     from browser code.
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY lives in .env.local and must never have a NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
     or be passed to client components.
   - Model: [the slug you chose, e.g. anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6]

   [If using RAG:]
   Embeddings:
   - Embedding model: openai/text-embedding-3-small via OpenRouter.
   - The documents table embedding column is vector(1536) — do not change this dimension.
   - Never change the embedding model after initial setup. Changing it breaks retrieval silently.
   ```

## Optional tasks

Complete at least one optional task via a dedicated feature branch and pull request.

### Easy

- **Model display.** Show the user which model is powering the AI feature (the OpenRouter slug, formatted readably). Useful for transparency and for your own cost tracking.
- **Streaming responses.** Ask the agent to stream the LLM response so words appear as they arrive, rather than after a pause. The prompt to give is: "Stream the AI response to the user so each word appears as it arrives rather than showing the full reply at once."
- **Usage or cost indicator.** Show the user a rough token count or cost estimate for each AI response, pulled from the OpenRouter response metadata.
- **Configure OpenRouter privacy settings.** Open your OpenRouter dashboard and make a deliberate decision about data retention, the training toggle, and whether Zero Data Retention is needed for the kind of data your users enter.

### Medium

- **Deploy to a live Vercel URL.** Deploy the app to Vercel so it is reachable at a live URL. Put every secret (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, Supabase keys) in the Vercel dashboard only — never in the repo and never in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable. Verify the deployment by opening it in a brand-new incognito window: it should show the sign-in page, not any user data.
- **Tuned system-prompt persona.** Spend a focused session refining the system prompt — testing different tones, personas, and rules until the AI feels genuinely distinct from a generic assistant.
- **User-selectable model.** Add a setting that lets the user choose from two or three model slugs. Show the name and relative cost of each. The model choice should be saved per user in Supabase.
- **Playwright tests for the AI feature.** Add automated tests covering at least the AI feature's happy path (send input, confirm a real AI response) and the signed-out visitor lockout (navigate to a protected route without signing in, confirm a redirect rather than data).

### Hard

- **Agentic RAG.** If your app already uses classic RAG, upgrade retrieval to agentic RAG: give the model "search the notes" as a tool it can choose to call. The model should decide whether to search at all, rewrite the query if results are poor, and chain multiple searches for complex questions. Follow the approach from the RAG lesson.
- **Multimodal input.** Let the user attach an image to a message. Pass the image to a vision-capable model via OpenRouter and incorporate what the model sees into the response. Store image references (not raw data) in Supabase.
- **Shareable AI outputs.** Let users publish a specific AI-generated result — a summary, a plan, a recipe — to a public read-only URL. Unauthenticated visitors can view the shared item but cannot access any other data.

## Evaluation criteria

1. The app has a clear, self-chosen purpose and the AI feature is demonstrably central — removing it would leave the app with no reason to exist. The student can explain this in their own words. **Weight: 3**
2. The AI feature works in the running app (deployed or run locally): a real LLM call happens, the result is visible to the user, and the call is server-side only. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` appears nowhere browser-accessible in the codebase or environment variables. **Weight: 3**
3. Supabase auth is in place and every table with user data has RLS enabled with at least one owner-scoped policy. A signed-out visitor is locked out of protected routes, verifiable in an incognito window (against the live URL if deployed, otherwise the locally running app). No service role key appears in any client-accessible variable. **Weight: 2**
4. `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (with AI rules pinned), `docs/` (at least one cited OpenRouter or Supabase AI/vectors reference with the source URL at the top), and at least one merged PR with an `ai-code-reviewer` report are all present and accurate. **Weight: 1**

### Bonus points

- A second optional task completed.
- Evidence of a cross-user privacy check: a test confirming that one user's AI context (conversation history, RAG chunks, or saved outputs) cannot be reached by a second user.

## Submission

Read an in-depth guide about reviews here.

### Submission and scheduling a project review

To submit the project and allow the reviewer to view your work beforehand, use the GitHub repository that has been created for you. Go through the course's materials on submitting projects, scheduling project reviews, and using GitHub.

Hand in the following before your 1-1 review call:

- Your Turing College GitHub repository URL.
- Live Vercel URL (if you deployed). If you completed the optional deployment, share the URL — your reviewer will open it in an incognito window before the call. If you did not deploy, be ready to run the app locally for your reviewer and confirm it requires sign-in.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, including the AI rules (model calls server-side only, key never browser-exposed; if using RAG, the embedding model and vector dimension pinned as shown in the task requirements).
- `docs/` folder with at least one cited reference — an OpenRouter or Supabase AI/vectors documentation page — with the source URL at the top of the file.
- At least one merged pull request with an `ai-code-reviewer` report recorded before it was merged.
- `README.md` covering: what the app does and what makes the AI feature its core; the live Vercel URL (if deployed); how to run it locally, including which environment variables to set and where to find the values; a screenshot of the app with the AI feature visible; and which optional task you chose.
